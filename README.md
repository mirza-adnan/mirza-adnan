### Hi

I'm **Mirza Adnan**, a software engineer.

I design and build whatever I think is cool, original or not.

Most of my expertise is in web development but is not limited to it.

The tech stack I am most familiar with is React, Typescript, Express.js/Spring Boot, Postgres, Tailwind (vanilla CSS is fine too) and framer motion.

Other than that, I am also quite comfortable with C/C++(had to learn because of uni) and even made a fun 2D game in C with SDL2 called Spurrint.

#### Fun Facts:
* I don't like coffee
* I love the Cars movie
