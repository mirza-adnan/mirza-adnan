### Hi

I'm **Mirza Adnan**, a software engineer.

I design and build whatever I think is cool, original or not.

Most of my projects are web apps, but I like to explore beyond web dev  whenever something catches my curiosity. My goto tech stack includes React, TypeScript, Express.js or Java Spring Boot, Postgres, Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS, no problem), and Framer Motion.

Outside the web, I’ve also spent quite a bit of time with C/C++ thanks to university and even built a fun little 2D game in C using SDL2 called Spurrint.

#### Fun Facts:
* I don't like coffee
* I love the Cars movie
